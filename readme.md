# **Readme**

## The following is information describes the content of the folder and how to run the code. 

## **How to run the files?**

1. Download this Github folder.
1. Download the zip containing the data from this Google Drive link: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MBKQxv3_DbxBzyM_jMW3yEwf60N-5m05?usp=sharing)
1. Unzip the folder named **Dataset** and put in your local Github repository you downloaded in the first step.
1. Run the below python files that you would like to analyze.


## **Executed python files:**

* **cell_counting.py**: Cell counting module, and choose the file you want to execute at the beginning of the script. The script will plot the different steps of the cell counting. 
* **final_segmentation_method.py**: Our final segmentation method and avg cell size calculation. It has the same structure as cell_counting.py, plots will show the different steps of segmentation and cell size estimation.  
* **cell_segmentation_Abdolhosseini_et_al.py**: Similar to final_segmentation_method.py but with Abdolhosseini et al's method. 
* **stats<span></span>.py**: statistics on the cell count and cell size per stage. Executing it will give the distribution of these features accross all images, as well as aggregates per stage. 
* **imageAlignment<span></span>.py**: image alignment 

## **Support python files**
These python files are meant to be imported by the executed python files. 

## **Other files and folders:**

* **report.pdf**: Contains the report
* **embryo_evolution.mov**: Contains a clip of the embryoâ€™s evolution, our dataset corresponds to the first 30 seconds. If you cannot read the file, you can do so with VLC media player. 
* **Dataset Folder**: Contains the dataset described in the report. 
* **Other Folders (Embryos, GeneExpression, Rectangles etc...)**: These are empty folders for the PCA<span></span>.py script. After you run it, they will contain the processed data necessary for the PCA.
